# ⏱️ ReacTick

Deterministic frame-based scheduling for games, AI, and simulations.

ReacTick is a tiny, fast, deterministic scheduler for running closures every `N` frames or after `N` frames, with *reactive scheduling conditions* that execute code when conditions are met.

It gives you:

* Declarative timing
* Reliable sequencing
* Simple cancellation
* AI/state-machine friendly tools (watch, when, cancelable)
* Safe, self-contained closures with captured variables
* Clean logic with no giant update loops or delta-time math

Perfect for:

* Entity AI
* NPC needs and behaviors
* Cooldowns & status effects
* Animation ticks
* Delayed events
* Cutscenes & scripts
* Procedural encounters
* Anything that should happen later, periodically, or based on conditions

ReacTick makes reactive temporal logic simple. Here's a simple example. 

If a player is in water, but hasn't learned to swim, they should take water damage
every second (assuming 60fps ReacTick). The following code is all you need 
to toggle water damage on a player that's currently in water. Player enters water, they take damage. Player exits water and they stop taking damage. Once they learn
to swim, this watcher and the associated callback will no longer be checked and the player will no longer take damage in water.

```nim
# More on `clock.cancelable` and `watch` later
clock.cancelable:
  # Player takes damage every second (60fps)
  clock.watch player.inWater, every(60) do():
    if player.canSwim:
      # Watcher/callback unscheduled here
      clock.cancel()
    else:
      player.takeWaterDamage()
```

## ✨ Why Use Frame-Based Scheduling?

Game timing often gets messy:

* Too many if timer > something checks
* Delta-time drift
* Branches everywhere
* Update order bugs
* Losing track of cooldowns or “run this later” logic

`ReacTick` solves this with:

✔️ Clean declarative scheduling

✔️ Deterministic execution

✔️ Zero delta-time math

✔️ Closures that capture state automatically

✔️ Cancellable tasks (Stop events when entities die)

✔️ Perfect for fixed-step game loops (Nico, SDL, OpenGL, etc.)

You just tell it *when* and *what* to run.

## 📦 Install
`nimble install https://github.com/RattleyCooper/ReacTick`

## 🚀 Quick Start
```nim
import reactick

var clock = ReacTick(fps: 60)

clock.run every(60) do():  # every 1 second at 60fps
  echo "One second passed!"

clock.run after(180) do(): # after 3 seconds
  echo "Three seconds passed!"

while true:
  clock.tick()
```

*Note: `N` must be `>= 1`.*

## 🧠 How Closures Work Here (Important!)

When you write:

```nim
var c = 0
clock.run every(60) do():
  c += 1
```

The `do():` block is a closure, meaning:

* It remembers the variables that were in scope when you created it
* It runs later, but still has access to those variables
* Even if you create many closures, each keeps its own reference of what it captured

That means you can write logic like:

* “Increase this specific cat’s age every second”
* “After 3 seconds rename only this cat”
* “Stop the game after `c` reaches 10”
* “Trigger unique behavior per entity with no global switch statements”

This makes your code *modular*, *clean*, and *expressive*.

Alternatively, you can use a `proc` with the `{.closure.}` pragma.

```nim
var c = 0
proc incC() {.closure.} =
  c += 1

clock.run every(60) incC
```

## 🛠 Core Scheduling Primitives
`run every(N)` Runs every `N` frames forever.

```nim
clock.run every(120) do():
  enemy.think()
```

`run after(N)` Runs *once* after `N` frames.

```nim
clock.run after(30) do():
  player.fireReady = true
```

`schedule` (get a task ID) Useful for cancellation.

```nim
let id = clock.schedule after(300) do(): 
  boss.enrage()
clock.cancel(id)
```

`watch` Runs callback at desired framerate when condition is met.

```nim
clock.cancelable:
  # Player takes damage every second (60fps)
  clock.watch player.inWater, every(60) do():
    if player.canSwim:
      # Watcher/callback unscheduled here
      clock.cancel()
    else:
      player.takeWaterDamage()
```

> Note: `watch` combined with `after` will only execute code *once* while the condition remains `true`, unlike `every` which gives you *repeating* executions *while* the condition remains `true`.

`when` Runs callbacks when a condition is `true`, then self-destructs.

```nim
# Cats will learn to hunt *once* the first time they reach starving condition
clock.when cat.hunger >= 60, after(60) do():
  cat.learnHunting()
```

## 🛑 Scheduling & Cancellation (Preventing Crashes)

Sometimes you schedule something to happen later (e.g., "Heal player in 3 seconds"), but the entity dies before that happens.

If you don't cancel the task, the closure will still run and try to heal a dead (or nil) player, often causing a crash.

### 🧟 The "Zombie Cat" Problem (Why you need this)

Imagine we schedule a name change for a `cat`, but we delete the `cat` variable before the schedule fires.

```nim
import reactick

type Cat = ref object
  name: string

proc newCat(name: string): Cat =
  # Create a new cat.
  result.new()
  result.name = name

var clock = ReacTick(fps: 60)
var scrubs = newCat("Scrubs")

# Schedule a task for the future
# Use 'schedule' instead of 'run' to get the Task ID
let renameTask = clock.schedule after(60) do():
  # If 'scrubs' is nil when this runs, the game crashes!
  if scrubs != nil:
    scrubs.name = "Ghost Scrubs" 
    echo "Renamed!"
  else:
    echo "Error: Cat does not exist!"

# Simulate the cat dying/being removed from the game
scrubs = nil 

# If we do NOTHING, the closure runs next second and might crash 
#    or perform logic on an invalid object.

# The Solution: Cancel the task!
clock.cancel(renameTask)

# Now, when we tick, nothing bad happens.
clock.tick()
```

Use `schedule` to get an ID, and `cancel` to stop it.

### 🎒 The "Bag of Tasks" Pattern (Recommended)

**For entities with multiple tasks**, store all task IDs in a `seq[int]` and `cancel` them all at once:

```nim
type Enemy = ref object
  name: string
  hp: int
  tasks: seq[int]  # Bag of all scheduled task IDs

proc setupEnemy(enemy: Enemy, clock: var ReacTick) =
  # Track enemy state changes to cancel later
  enemy.tasks.add clock.schedule after(600) do():
    enemy.nextState()

proc removeEnemy(enemy: Enemy, clock: var ReacTick) =
  # Cancel ALL tasks with one call and clears their task list.
  clock.cancel(enemy.tasks)
  # Now safe to remove enemy from the game
```

## 👀 Reactive Scheduling with Conditions

(The most powerful part of ReacTick)

`watch condition, every(N)`

Runs every N frames while condition is true.

Perfect for reversible behaviors:

* “meow until fed”
* “nap until rested”
* “take poison damage while poisoned”
* “regen stamina while resting”

```nim
# Regenerate health if health is ever below 50
clock.watch player.hp < 50, every(30) do():
  player.regen(1)
```

Stops *automatically* when the condition becomes false and *continues* when the condition becomes true again.

`when condition, after(N)`

Schedules a one-shot event that triggers `N` frames after the condition becomes true, then cancels itself.

Great for permanent “unlock once” events:

* learn a skill
* trigger a cutscene
* evolve a creature
* apply a debuff once

```nim
clock.when enemy.hp <= 0, after(1) do():
  enemy.die() # presumably canceling tasks in enemy.die()
```

| API | Runs  | Repeats? | Stops automatically? | Returns Task ID | Task Ids Needed to Cancel |
| --- | ----- | -------- | -------------------- | --- | --- |
| `run every(N)`| Every N frames |✔️|❌|❌| 1 |
| `run after(N)`| Once |❌|✔️|❌| 1 |
| `schedule every(N)` | Every N frames |✔️|❌|✔️| Use Returned |
| `schedule after(N)` | Once  | ❌  | ✔️  |✔️| Use Returned |
| `watch cond, every(N)` | Every N frames *while cond is true* |✔️|✔️ (until cond true again) |❌| 2 |
| `watch cond, after(N)` | Once N frames *when cond* is true |❌|✔️ (util cond true again)|❌| 2 |
| `when cond, after(N)`| Once |❌| ✔️ **Always self-cancels**|❌| 2 |


## 🔒 Cancelable Blocks

Sometimes you want a whole block of watchers and tasks to be removed permanently after some condition succeeds.

Use:

```nim
clock.cancelable:
  # all tasks created here can be individually 
  # canceled with `cancel` within their closure.
  clock.watch something, every(30) do():
    if done:
      clock.cancel() # removes everything defined in this block and the watcher

  clock.watch somethingElse, every(30) do():
    if done:
      clock.cancel() # Removes this individual watcher/callback.
```

This is ideal for:

* skill learning
* progression gates
* temporary states
* “burn out” or “fleeing” AI
* multi-step interactions

> *Examples in readme.*

`ReacTick.cancelable` does something under the hood using macros.

This code:

```nim
clock.cancelable:
  clock.watch scrubs.inWater, every(60) do():
    if scrubs.canSwim:
      clock.cancel()
    elif scrubs.health <= 80:
      scrubs.learnToSwim()
    else:
      scrubs.takeWaterDamage()
```

Gets transformed into this code:

```nim
block:
  # Pulls in ids that will be used for the
  # closures.
  var watcherId = clock.nextId + 1
  var cbId = clock.nextId
  clock.watch scrubs.inWater, every(60)do :
    if scrubs.canSwim:
      # Uses IDs to unschedule the closures.
      clock.cancel(watcherId)
      clock.cancel(cbId)
    elif scrubs.health <= 80:
      scrubs.learnToSwim()
    else:
      scrubs.takeWaterDamage()
```

## Canceling `watch`ers and their closures explicitly

If you want to cancel things explicitly you can get the task ids using `ReacTick.nextIds(amount)`. The `amount` defaults to `2` and returns a sequence containing your ids. `2` ids are needed for the `watch`er and it's associated closure. This is good for objects that may become `nil` and hold their task ids. `nextIds` must be called just before creating the `watch`er.

```nim
# Need to get 2 ids to cancel a watcher and the associated closure.
enemy.tasks.add clock.nextIds()
clock.watch enemy.onFire, every(60) do():
  enemy.takeFireDamage()

# Remove enemy tasks before they become nil
# to prevent accessing invalid memory.
clock.cancel enemy.tasks
```

> This is useful when you need to manually cancel a `watch` before its condition resolves (e.g., when an entity is destroyed).

## 🧩 Patterns & Usage

### ✔ Reversible Behaviors → `watch`

Use `watch` for things that should repeatedly activate while a condition is true:

* hunger → meow → eat → satisfied
* low stamina → nap → rested
* poisoned → lose health → cured

`watch` *automatically stops* when the condition becomes false, and *continues* when the condition becomes true. This facilitates the creation of complex state transitions with a clean, declarative syntax.

### ✔ One-Shot Triggers → `when`

Use `when` for:

* achievements
* permanent skill unlocks
* “do this once when X becomes true”
* cutscene triggers
* Self-canceling.

`when` is great for non-repeating conditional behavior.

### ✔ Temporary States → `cancelable`:

Use cancelable blocks when you want a state machine step that *eventually* ends forever.

Example: *"learning to swim”*:

* cat enters water
* take damage
* eventually learns
* damage behavior never runs again

## ⏱️ About Delta-Time (Do You Need It?)

`ReacTick` does not use delta-time internally — and it doesn’t need to.

Why?

Because `ReacTick` is not a game loop or physics integrator.

It’s simply:

A tiny scheduler that runs closures after or every N frames.

It doesn’t care what you use your frames for:

* Rendering
* Physics
* AI updates
* Scripted events
* Gameplay timers
* Cooldowns
* Cutscenes
* Anything else

Your frame loop could be tied to rendering, but it doesn't have to be.

## ❌ When Delta-Time Is Not Needed

* If you are only using `ReacTick` as:
* a scheduler
* a timed-event system
* a frame-based sequencer

then no delta-time math is required at all.

It’s intentionally simple:

```nim
clock.run after(180) do(): # run this after 180 frames
clock.run every(60) do():     # run this every 60 frames
```

That’s it.

## ✔ When Delta-Time Is Useful (Outside This Library)

If your game or program has variable framerate and you want:

* consistent player movement
* physics updates
* interpolation
* velocity-based animations

Then you might want dt in your game loop.

Example:

```nim
let dt = elapsedTimeSeconds()
player.x += player.speed * dt
```

This is completely separate from how you use the scheduler.
